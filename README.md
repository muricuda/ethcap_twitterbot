# ethcap_twitterbot
This is the first coding project I have ever worked on. The twitter bot updates daily. It provides Ethereum's market cap and compares it to the next largest company in the S&amp;P 500.

Update: yahoo-finance does not work anymore. Updated with IEX API (python wrapper). Also, after looking back on this code, it is very terribly written - granted it was my first coding project.
